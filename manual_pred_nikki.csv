M,24724,We all know the traditional model of a terrorist network. One cell controlling all others. Cut off the head and the body will wither.
M,260205,(beat) Who's your brother?
M,209583,Yeah.
M,106016,"Ashley, wait!"
M,46228,You can't be late though.
M,156678,"No, sir. Pediatric convention in Delaware."
M,33287,Stage IV thyroid cancer.
M,239395,(On phone) Damn it! That simply won't-- Richard glances up. Sees Hannah standing there. He stops in mid-sentence. Smiles.
F,200956,"You see, that picture is worth any number of speeches."
F,121333,(getting a little excitable) I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
M,94220,Certainly.
F,119184,"Come on, honey, let's get out of here."
M,229489,Congratulations.
M,128465,Feel like traveling?
F,22660,"Don't fucking yell at me, Paul."
M,143621,I remember everything until we crashed. I know what went on.
M,262295,I don't want to say I told you so. But I did. Can I go back to work now?
F,75233,"You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want."
M,145502,"(snaps) I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!"
M,259122,What?
M,104927,(calls out) What is it?
M,116218,I don't...I...
M,215979,Who the hell is this? Napoleon? Who the fuck (hell) are you calling?
F,161481,Some of it's true.
M,132918,So what're you worried about?
F,46413,In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
M,138362,"Oh, it will be, Dr. Jones, I assure you. We have top men working on it right now."
F,95913,Could you spare some?
F,65283,Backstabber?
M,99378,(indignantly) Jack high. Can you beat that?
M,72446,"My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. So that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity."
M,109105,Very clever.
M,165852,You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
F,69190,If only you knew what I know.
F,36651,I'm worried.
F,8231,I love the symphony.
F,4957,No.
M,196511,Or was it the left shoulder?
M,85692,"In the old days, Nicky would've decked him with one shot."
M,186934,"Now gather `round. Come on now, in a circle. I want ya'll to join hands."
M,277025,"With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!"
M,264260,"(the hex working now) Oh, well, I see you've been gaining a lot of insight into your... girl powers..."
M,151579,"We spun the ad campaign to give the mission a friendly face, keep people from panicking in the streets. We partnered with Coke because the 900 billion this mission cost would have bankrupted the government. The SinoJordanian Alliance knows the truth as well as we do. They hope to reach Alpha Prime first - And if they do, I guarantee you, they will not share the Dimondium with Western Demons like us. our crops will wither. We will be left to die."
M,147457,"Look, can't we sit in the car and talk about it, instead of running all over Route Twelve?"
M,82510,People always do what you tell them to do ?
M,285145,The second wave has not returned.  And w have no idea where their carriers are. What is the damage report?
F,241553,"Not from a cell phone, no."
F,76263,Don't count on it. In her one year at Ole Miss she never cracked a book.
F,182732,Good for you.
M,186918,Born. And they're getting stronger. 7
F,14100,Stockings are why I love Christmas. You wanna get outta here? This place is too loud for me. 55.
M,187538,We grew up together. Kids.
M,146883,Yes. I need the EMP cannon-guidance mount from the Bat. You remember where you parked?
F,7338,What are you doing?
M,186504,Been thinking about Miami. There's nothing to keep me here.
F,106535,(grins) I like that.
F,164129,Shush.
M,212615,Hi !
F,90033,(flatly) No.
M,222274,Eight months of this? I'd rather kill myself.
M,231717,"Yeah, ha ha, glad I had it."
M,151560,John Crawford?
M,283384,Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
M,222491,I don't know why Hugh Perceval sent you here. There's nothing I can do for you.
F,4414,What?
M,10877,"(manages, barely) I go on rounds."
F,277929,I live in Connecticut. I haven't used it in a long time.
F,163059,Who?
M,273774,"They're traveling the rest of the year on the money, going where the waves are..."
M,147619,We're going to be okay.
F,45287,Let's get out of here!
F,38942,"I'm so sorry, Mark."
F,181010,(covering ears in pain) Ooh! I hate that word.
M,135631,(Off) That's what they call a family problem.
M,255142,"Your time is up, busyboy."
M,285707,(giving her an embarrassed hug) Vivian...
F,239002,"I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little."
M,101569,Nervous?
M,257511,I thought Meeks hung people.
M,180249,You.
M,199713,"(tonelessly, prodding Smith off the fender with his rifle) Hands behind your head."
F,32667,Oh.   That writer you like?
M,114440,Where's the body?
M,58578,"(behind curtain) Bill? No, no, no! What have you done? Bill!"
M,190650,"""Missing his aim, he fell into a ditch, turning completely over as he went; and striking his head against a stone, dashed his brains out."
M,256424,"You were messed up, man."
M,62073,"Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again."
F,22473,Here he is now. (calls out) Mo?
M,139809,As if you had so many more appealing options.
F,234171,Just turn it. Come on.
F,283466,That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.
F,228812,No.
M,50532,"I'm ... just ... Linda Litzke. Harry stares at her. A long beat. He leaps to his feet and looks around in a panic. His point-of-view, sweeping the park. Nearby, the man with plugs, though talking with his date, is looking at him again. Farther away, a man sits in a curbside sedan. Watching? Hard to say. Harry turns and runs.       Linda gapes."
M,240710,"I'll ask you one last time, detective. Where is the tape?"
M,222202,Raphael is buried at the Pantheon.
F,182457,I don't need to ask. I know you.
M,245140,I was going to catch the last half on TV.
M,260000,"It's confidential, Bud.  Like that magazines Vincennes scams for. Hush-Hush . (smiles) I'll see you tomorrow.  And hey, if it works out, you'll get a piece of it."
M,267421,Pulverized?
F,222000,Next one.
