15786	Drama	1	DUSSANDER	...but, as the war pressed on, the time for such civilized measures became a luxury.  i remember by april of 'numtoknumtok, we had barely enough food to feed ourselves.  the sound of the russian mortars grew louder everyday, but still, the train cars from france and poland kept coming.  this was a time of desperation. the ovens burned day and night and still i knew we would not beat the arrival of the russian forces.  many of my men, the cowardly ones, deserted during the night.  but the men that remained, the same ones i had called upon so many times, ...continued the work. at first we thought a massive fire in the main building would serve our purpose.  we could just crowd them in and pull a gas torch up to each of the windows.  but with so many of them, we couldn't be sure the bodies would burn properly.  we needed something ...certain.  then a young, bright soldier, i shall never forget his enthusiastic smile, pointed to a pair of bulldozers near the western gate which had been used during construction.  how perfectly simple it was. the bulldozers carved a narrow trench, four meters deep, down the center of the camp. for two hours they dug until i realized we may not have enough gas to finish the job. so the inmates were given shovels and told they were building a shelter from the incoming artillery.  when they were done, i immediately called for a practice drill and three thousand naked bodies began to march into the trench.  it took less than twenty minutes to get them in place.  quickly the bulldozers moved down the sides of the pit sending the piles of earth into the massive grave.  those who tried to free themselves were shot, of course, but very few cartridges were wasted that day.  the machines were too fast.  back and forth they went... packing the dirt.  one by one the tractors ran out of gas and my men had to scurry along with shovels.  but by sunset... it was done.  i gave the order to evacuate.  in the distance the plumes of russian mortar fire rose like an approaching thundercloud.  but i knew that no matter what happened, ...no one would ever forget what we did here.	1.0	382

""i would never wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member."" that's the key joke of my adult life in terms of my relationships with women.  tsch, you know, lately the strangest things have been going through my mind, 'cause i turned forty, tsch, and i guess i'm going through a life crisis or something, i don't know. i, uh ... and i'm not worried about aging. i'm not one o' those characters, you know. although i'm balding slightly on top, that's about the worst you can say about me.  i, uh, i think i'm gonna get better as i get older, you know?  i think i'm gonna be the- the balding virile type, you know, as opposed to say the, uh, distinguished gray, for instance, you know?  'less i'm neither o' those two. unless i'm one o' those guys with saliva dribbling out of his mouth who wanders into a cafeteria with a shopping bag screaming about socialism.  annie and i broke up and i-i still can't get my mind around that.  you know, i-i keep sifting the pieces of the relationship through my mind and-and examining my life and tryin' to figure out where did the screw-up come, you know, and a year ago we were... tsch, in love.  you know, and-and-an ... and it's funny, i'm not-i'm not a morose type.  i'm not a depressive character"	1.0	337
