""i would never wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member."" that's the key joke of my adult life in terms of my relationships with women.  tsch, you know, lately the strangest things have been going through my mind, 'cause i turned forty, tsch, and i guess i'm going through a life crisis or something, i don't know. i, uh ... and i'm not worried about aging. i'm not one o' those characters, you know. although i'm balding slightly on top, that's about the worst you can say about me.  i, uh, i think i'm gonna get better as i get older, you know?  i think i'm gonna be the- the balding virile type, you know, as opposed to say the, uh, distinguished gray, for instance, you know?
